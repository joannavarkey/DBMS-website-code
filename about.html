                the airline is a subsidiary of The Emirates Group, which is owned by the government of Dubai's Investment 
                Corporation of Dubai. As of 2019, it was also the largest airline in the Middle East,operating over
                 3,600 flights per week from its hub at Terminal 3 of Dubai International Airport. It operates to more than
                  150 cities in 80 countries across all continents (except Antarctica) through its fleet of nearly 300 aircraft.

                 in terms of freight tonne-kilometers flown</p>
            <p>Emirates operates a mixed fleet of Airbus and Boeing wide-body aircraft, and is one of the few airlines to operate an all-wide-body aircraft fleet.
